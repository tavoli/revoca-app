Yesterday I was <strong class="font-bold bg-green-600 rounded-md">writing</strong> a serious article on a philosophical subject while a conversation was going on in the room. I notice that one can always write best when somebody is talking through a telephone close by. Well, the thing began in this way. A member of our <strong class="font-bold bg-green-600 rounded-md">household</strong> came in and asked me to have our house put into communication with Mr Bagley's. I have observed, in many cities, that women, as a rule, do not like to call up the central office themselves. I don't know why, but they don't. So I touched the bell, and this talk followed:</p><p id="1985" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Central Office. Hello!</p><p id="1986" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">I. Is it the Central Office?</p><p id="1987" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">C. O. Of course it is. What do you want?</p><p id="1988" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">I. Will you connect me with the Bagleys, please?</p><p id="1989" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">C. O. All right. Just keep your ear to the telephone.</p><p id="1990" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Then I heard, k-look, k-look, k-look-klock-klock-klook- look-look!, then a terrible "gritting" of teeth, and finally a female voice: Y-e-s? Did you wish to speak to me?</p><p id="1991" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Without answering, I handed the telephone to the woman and sat down. Then followed the strangest of all the strange things in this world - a conversation with only one end to it. You hear questions asked; you don't hear the answer. You hear invitations given; you hear no thanks in return. You listen to pauses of dead silence, followed by exclamations of glad surprise or <strong class="font-bold bg-green-600 rounded-md">sorrow</strong> or alarm. You can't make head or <strong class="font-bold bg-green-600 rounded-md">tail</strong> of the talk, because you never hear anything that the person at the other end of the <strong class="font-bold bg-green-600 rounded-md">wire</strong> says. Well, I heard the following series of observations, all from the one tongue, and all <strong class="font-bold bg-green-600 rounded-md">shouted</strong> - for you can't make women speak gently into a telephone:</p><p id="1992" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Yes? Why, how did that happen?</p><p id="1993" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="1994" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">What did you say?</p><p id="1995" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="1996" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Oh no, I don't think it was.</p><p id="1997" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="1998" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">No! Oh, no, I didn't mean that. I meant, put it in while it is still <strong class="font-bold bg-green-600 rounded-md">boiling</strong> - or just before it comes to a boil.</p><p id="1999" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2000" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">What?</p><p id="2001" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2002" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">What did you say? (Aside.) Children, do be quiet!</p><p id="2003" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2004" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Oh! Dear me, I thought you said it was the cat.</p><p id="2005" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2006" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Since when?</p><p id="2007" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2008" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Why, I never heard of it.</p><p id="2009" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2010" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">You <strong class="font-bold bg-green-600 rounded-md">astonish</strong> me greatly! It seems <strong class="font-bold bg-green-600 rounded-md">utterly</strong> impossible!</p><p id="2011" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2012" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Who did?</p><p id="2013" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2014" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Goodness gracious!</p><p id="2015" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2016" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Well, what is this world coming to? Was it right in church?</p><p id="2017" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2018" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">And was her mother there?</p><p id="2019" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2020" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Why, Mrs Bagley, I should have died of humiliation! What did they do?</p><p id="2021" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Long pause.</p><p id="2022" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">I can't be perfectly sure, because I haven't the notes by me; but I think it goes something like this: te-rolly, loll-loll, loll-lolly-loll-loll. O tolly-loll-loll-lee-ly-li-i-do! And then repeat, you know.</p><p id="2023" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2024" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Yes, I think it is very sweet - and very solemn and impressive, if you get the andantino and the pianissimo right.</p><p id="2025" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2026" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Oh, gum-drops, gum-drops! But I never allow them to eat the candy. And of course they can't, till they get their teeth, anyway.</p><p id="2027" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2028" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">What?</p><p id="2029" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2030" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Oh, not in the least - go right on. He's here <strong class="font-bold bg-green-600 rounded-md">writing</strong> - it doesn't bother him.</p><p id="2031" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2032" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Very well, I'll come if I can. (Aside.) Dear me, how it does tire a person's arm to hold this thing up so long! I wish she'd -</p><p id="2033" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2034" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Oh no, not at all; I like to talk - but I'm afraid I'm keeping you from your affairs.</p><p id="2035" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2036" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Visitors?</p><p id="2037" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2038" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">No, we never use butter on them.</p><p id="2039" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2040" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Yes, that is a very good way; but all the cookbooks say they are very unhealthy when they are out of season. And he doesn't like them, anyway - especially canned.</p><p id="2041" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2042" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Oh, I think that is too dear for them; we have never paid over fifty cents a bunch.</p><p id="2043" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2044" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Must you go? Well, good-bye.</p><p id="2045" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause. Yes, I think so. Good-bye.</p><p id="2046" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2047" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Four o'clock, then - I'll be ready. Good-bye.</p><p id="2048" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2049" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Thank you ever so much. Good-bye.</p><p id="2050" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Pause.</p><p id="2051" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Oh, not at all - just as fresh - Which? Oh, I'm glad to hear you say that. Good-bye.</p><p id="2052" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">(Hangs the telephone and says, "Oh, it does tire a person's arm so!").</p><p id="2053" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">BILLIARDS</p><p id="2054" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">The game of billiards has destroyed my naturally kind temper. Once, when I was an underpaid reporter in Virginia City, whenever I wished to play billiards I went out to look for an easy mark. One day a stranger came to the town and opened a billiard parlor. I looked him over carelessly. When he proposed a game, I answered, "All right."</p><p id="2055" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Just knock the balls around a little so that I can get your gait," he said; and when I had done so, he remarked: "I will be perfectly honest with you. I'll play you left-handed." I felt hurt, for he was cross-eyed, freckled, and had red hair, and I decided to teach him a lesson. He won first shot, ran out, and took my half-dollar.</p><p id="2056" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"If you can play like that with your left hand," I said, "I'd like to see you play with your right."</p><p id="2057" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Cannot play at all," he said, "I'm left-handed."</p><p id="2058" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A FABLE</p><p id="2059" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Once upon a time an artist who had painted a small and very beautiful picture placed it so that he could see it in the mirror. He said, "This doubles the distance and softens it, and it is twice as lovely as it was before."</p><p id="2060" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">The animals in the wood heard of this through the housecat, who was greatly admired by them because he was learned, and so civilized, and so polite and well-bred, and could tell them so much which they didn't know before, and were not certain about afterward. They were much excited about the news, and they asked questions, so as to understand it. They asked what a picture was, and the cat explained.</p><p id="2061" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"It is a flat thing," he said; "wonderfully flat, and elegant. And, oh, so beautiful!"</p><p id="2062" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">That excited them very much, and they said they would give the world to see it. Then the bear asked:</p><p id="2063" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"What is it that makes it so beautiful?"</p><p id="2064" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">''It is the looks of it," said the cat.</p><p id="2065" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">This filled them with admiration and uncertainty, and they were more excited than ever. Then the cow asked:</p><p id="2066" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"What is a mirror?"</p><p id="2067" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"It is a hole in the wall," said the cat. "You look in it, and there you see the picture, and it is so charming in its unimaginable beauty that your head turns round and round, and you almost faint with ecstasy."</p><p id="2068" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">The ass had not said anything as yet, he now began to throw doubts. He said there had never been anything as beautiful as this before, and probably wasn't now. He said that when it took a whole basketful of long adjectives to praise a thing of beauty, it was time for suspicion.</p><p id="2069" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">It was easy to see that these doubts had an effect upon the animals, so the cat went off offended. The subject was dropped for a couple of days, but in the meantime curiosity was taking a fresh start, and there was a revival of interest. Then the animals scolded the ass for spoiling what could possibly have been a pleasure to them, on a suspicion that the picture was not beautiful, without any evidence that such was the case. The ass was not troubled; he was calm, and said there was one way to find out who was right, himself or the cat; he would go and look in that hole, and come back and tell what he found there. The animals felt relieved and grateful, and asked him to go at once - which he did.</p><p id="2070" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">But he did not know where he ought to stand; and so, by mistake, he stood between the picture and the mirror. The result was that he did not see the picture. He returned home and said:</p><p id="2071" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"The cat lied. There was nothing in that hole but an ass. There wasn't a sign of a flat thing visible. It was a handsome ass, and friendly, but just an ass, and nothing more."</p><p id="2072" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">The elephant asked:</p><p id="2073" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Did you see it good and clear? Were you close to it?"</p><p id="2074" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"I saw it good and clear, O Hathi, King of Beasts. I was so close that I touched noses with it."</p><p id="2075" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"This is very strange," said the elephant; "the cat was always truthful before - as far as we could see. Let another witness try. Go, Baloo, look in the hole, and come and report."</p><p id="2076" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">So the bear went. When he came back, he said:</p><p id="2077" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Both the cat and the ass have lied; there was nothing in the hole but a bear."</p><p id="2078" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Great was the surprise and puzzlement of the animals. Each was now anxious to make the test himself and find out the truth. The elephant sent them one at a time.</p><p id="2079" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">First, the cow. She found nothing in the hole but a cow.</p><p id="2080" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">The tiger found nothing in it but a tiger.</p><p id="2081" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">The lion found nothing in it but a lion.</p><p id="2082" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">The leopard found nothing in it but a leopard.</p><p id="2083" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">The camel found a camel, and nothing more.</p><p id="2084" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Then Hathi got angry, and said he would have the truth, if he had to go and find out himself. When he returned, he called them all liars, and was in a great fury with the moral and mental blindness of the cat.</p><p id="2085" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">He said that anybody but a near-sighted fool could see that there was nothing in the hole but an elephant.</p><p id="2086" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Moral, by the cat.</p><p id="2087" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">You can find in a text whatever you put in, if you will stand between it and the mirror of your imagination. You may not see your ears, but they will be there.</p><p id="2088" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL</p><p id="2089" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Just about the end of that long, hard winter," said the Sunday-school superintendent, "as I was going to school one brilliant morning, I glanced down toward the embankment and there lay the City of Hartford steamer! No mistake about it: there she was, puffing after her long journey through the ice. A glad sight? Well, I should say so! And then came a thought: I should instruct empty benches, sure, the youngsters would all be off welcoming the first steamboat of the season. You can imagine how surprised I was when I opened the door and saw half the benches full. My gratitude was large, and sincere. I decided that they should not find me ungrateful.</p><p id="2090" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"I said, 'Boys, you cannot think how proud it makes me to see you here. I confess that I said to myself, as I came along and saw that the City of Hartford was in-''</p><p id="2091" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"No! but is she, though? ''</p><p id="2092" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"And, as quick as any flash of lightning, I stood in the presence of empty benches! I had brought them the news myself."</p><p id="2093" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">AN ENCOUNTER WITH AN INTERVIEWER</p><p id="2094" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">The nervous, energetic young man took the chair I offered him, and said he was connected with the Daily Thunderstorm, and added:</p><p id="2095" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"I hope it's no harm, I've come to interview you."</p><p id="2096" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Come to what?"</p><p id="2097" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Interview you."</p><p id="2098" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Ah! I see. Yes-yes. Um! Yes-yes."</p><p id="2099" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">I went to the bookcase, and after I had been looking six or seven minutes I found I was obliged to refer to the young man. I said:</p><p id="2100" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"How do you spell it?"</p><p id="2101" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Spell what?"</p><p id="2102" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Interview."</p><p id="2103" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Oh, my goodness! what do you want to spell it for?"</p><p id="2104" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"I don't want to spell it; I want to see what it means."</p><p id="2105" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Well, this is astonishing, I must say. I can tell you what it means, if you - if you -"</p><p id="2106" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Oh, all right! That will answer, and much obliged to you, too."</p><p id="2107" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"In, in, ter, ter, inter -"</p><p id="2108" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Then you spell it with an I?"</p><p id="2109" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Why, certainly!"</p><p id="2110" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Oh, that is what took me so long."</p><p id="2111" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Why, my dear sir, what did you propose to spell it with?"</p><p id="2112" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Well, I - I hardly know. I had the Unabridged, and I was looking up in the back end, hoping I might find her among the pictures. But it's a very old edition."</p><p id="2113" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Why, my friend, they wouldn't have a picture of it in even the latest e -. My dear sir, I beg your pardon, I mean no harm in the world, but you do not look as - as - intelligent as I had expected you would. No harm - I mean no harm at all."</p><p id="2114" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Oh, don't mention it! It has often been said, and by people who could have no intention to flatter, that I am quite remarkable in that way. Yes-yes; they always speak of it with ecstasy."</p><p id="2115" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"I can easily imagine it. But about this interview. You know it is the custom, now, to interview any man who has become notorious."</p><p id="2116" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Indeed, I had not heard of it before. It must be very interesting. What do you do it with?"</p><p id="2117" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Ah, well - well - well - this is awful. It ought to be done with a club in some cases; but usually it consists in the interviewer asking questions and the interviewed answering them. Will you let me ask you certain questions about some interesting points of your public and private history?"</p><p id="2118" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Oh, with pleasure - with pleasure. I have a very bad memory, but I hope you will not mind that."</p><p id="2119" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Oh, it is no matter, so you will try to do the best you can."</p><p id="2120" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"I will."</p><p id="2121" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Thanks. Are you ready to begin?"</p><p id="2122" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">"Ready."</p><p id="2123" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. How old are you?</p><p id="2124" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Nineteen in June.</p><p id="2125" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Indeed. I would have taken you to be thirty-five or six. Where were you born?</p><p id="2126" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. In Missouri.</p><p id="2127" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. When did you begin to write?</p><p id="2128" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. In 1836.</p><p id="2129" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Why, how could that be, if you are only nineteen now?</p><p id="2130" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. I don't know. It does seem curious, somehow.</p><p id="2131" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. It does, indeed. Whom do you consider the most remarkable man you ever met?</p><p id="2132" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Aaron Burr.</p><p id="2133" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. But you never could have met Aaron Burr, if you are only nineteen years -</p><p id="2134" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Now, if you know more about me than I do, what do you ask me for?</p><p id="2135" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Well, it was only a suggestion; nothing more. How did you happen to meet Burr?</p><p id="2136" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Well, I happened to be at his funeral one day, and he asked me to make less noise, and -</p><p id="2137" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. But, good heavens! If you were at his funeral, he must have been dead, and if he was dead how could he care whether you made a noise or not?</p><p id="2138" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. I don't know. He was always a particular kind of a man that way.</p><p id="2139" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Still, I don't understand it at all. You say he spoke to you, and that he was dead.</p><p id="2140" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. I didn't say he was dead.</p><p id="2141" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. But wasn't he dead?</p><p id="2142" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Well, some said he was, some said he wasn't.</p><p id="2143" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. What did you think?</p><p id="2144" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Oh, it was none of my business! It wasn't any of my funeral.</p><p id="2145" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Did you - Well - Let me ask about something else. What was the date of your birth?</p><p id="2146" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Monday, October 31, 1693.</p><p id="2147" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. What! Impossible! Then you are a hundred and eighty years old. How can you explain that?</p><p id="2148" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. I can't explain it at all.</p><p id="2149" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. But you said at first you were only nineteen, and now you say you are one hundred and eighty. It is an awful discrepancy.</p><p id="2150" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Why, have you noticed that? (Shaking hands.) Many a time it has seemed to me like a discrepancy, but somehow I couldn't make up my mind. How quick you notice a thing!</p><p id="2151" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Thank you for the compliment. Had you, or have you, any brothers or sisters?</p><p id="2152" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Eh! I - I - I think so - yes - but I don't remember.</p><p id="2153" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Well, that is the most extraordinary statement I ever heard!</p><p id="2154" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Why, what makes you think that?</p><p id="2155" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. How could I think otherwise? Why, look here! Whose picture is it on the wall? Isn't that a brother of yours?</p><p id="2156" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Oh, yes, yes, yes! Now you remind me of it; that was a brother of mine. That's William - Bill we called him. Poor old Bill!</p><p id="2157" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Why? Is he dead, then?</p><p id="2158" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Ah! well, I suppose so. We never could tell. There was a great mystery about it.</p><p id="2159" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. That is sad, very sad. He disappeared, then?</p><p id="2160" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Well, yes, in a sort of general way. We buried him.</p><p id="2161" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Buried him! Buried him, without knowing whether he was dead or not?</p><p id="2162" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Oh, no! Not that. He was dead enough.</p><p id="2163" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Well, I confess that I can't understand this. If you buried him, and you knew he was dead -</p><p id="2164" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. No! no! We only thought he was.</p><p id="2165" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Oh, I see! He came to life again?</p><p id="2166" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. I believe he didn't.</p><p id="2167" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Well, I never heard anything like this. Somebody was dead. Somebody was buried. Now, where was the mystery?</p><p id="2168" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. You see, we were twins - the dead man and I - and we got mixed in the bathtub when we were only two weeks old, and one of us was drowned. But we didn't know which. Some think it was Bill. Some think it was me.</p><p id="2169" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Well, that is remarkable. What do you think?</p><p id="2170" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Goodness knows! I would give whole worlds to know. This solemn, this awful mystery has cast a gloom over my whole life. But I will tell you a secret now, which I never have revealed to any creature before. One of us had a peculiar mark - a large mole on the back of his left hand; that was me. That child was the one that was drowned!</p><p id="2171" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Very well, then, I don't see that there is any mystery about it, after all.</p><p id="2172" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. You don't? Well, I do. Anyway, I don't see how they could ever have buried the wrong child. But, 'sh! - don't mention it where the family can hear of it. Heaven knows they have heart-breaking troubles enough without adding this.</p><p id="2173" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Q. Well, I believe I have got material enough for the present, and I am very much obliged to you for that. But I was a good deal interested in Aaron Burr's funeral. Would you mind telling me what made you think Burr was such a remarkable man?</p><p id="2174" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">A. Oh! It was a mere trifle! When the sermon was over, and the procession all ready to start for the cemetery, and the body all arranged nice in the hearse, he said he wanted to take a last look at the scenery, and so he got up and rode with the driver.</p><p id="2175" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">Then the young man withdrew. He was very pleasant company, and I was sorry to see him go.</p><p id="2176" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">HOW I HONESTLY EARNED THREE DOLLARS</p><p id="2177" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">In some ways I was always honest; even from my earliest years I could never bring myself to use money which I had earned in questionable ways; many a time I tried, but principle was always stronger than desire. Six or eight months ago, Lieut.-Gen. Nelson A. Miles was given a great dinner party in New York, and when he and I were talking together in the drawing-room before going out to dinner he said: "I've known you as much as thirty years, isn't it?"</p><p id="2178" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">I said, "Yes, that's about it, I think."</p><p id="2179" class="py-4 pl-14 pr-4 relative">He thought a moment or two and then said, "We met in Washington in 1867; you were there at that time, weren't you?"</p>
