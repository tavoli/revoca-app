# Bugs

- The AI actions are not providing full results when the text is too long - That's because the free tier of the Serverless Functions I'm using has a limit of 10 seconds of execution time. I'm working on a solution for that.
- The login token have a expiration time and I have not implemented a way to refresh it yet. So if you leave the app open for too long, you will have to login again.
- When creating a new text, paste a too long text can make the app crash. I'm working on a solution for that. - That because Quill, the text editor, create a new node for every new line.

# Future Improvements Ideas

- Add a way to refresh the login token.
- Add a way to delete the text you added.
- Add a text-to-speech feature.
