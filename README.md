# Identified Issues

- The AI functionality is not displaying comprehensive results when processing an extensive text. This limitation is due to the 10-second execution time cap set by the free serverless functions platform we use. We are currently developing a workaround to address this.
- The login token has a predetermined expiry time, and, currently, our system lacks a refresh function. Consequently, prolonged idle periods may necessitate a new login. We are investigating a suitable solution.
- The app experiences performance issues or may crash when users paste large amounts of text when creating a new document. This problem originates from our text editor, Quill, which creates a new node for each line. We are striving to rectify this issue.

# Potential Enhancements for Future Development

- Develop a feature for refreshing login authentication tokens.
- Incorporate a function to enable the deletion of previously added text.
- Implement a text-to-speech functionality to improve user experience.
